I am fortunate in that I have reached a stage in my life where I have achieved everything I have ever wanted to do in my life, so I am more willing to try new things and to stretch myself.

I like to be involved in activities that interest me, doing things that I am passionate about or believe I can add value to. I enjoy interacting with people, and I admire how each individual has different strengths and values, but together we complement each other to achieve something greater than each of us. I celebrate successes and learn from failures, for myself and others or as part of an outcome.
