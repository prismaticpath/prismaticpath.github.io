title: Fill in the Dots
categories:

Leaving things undone, deserting a project too early, not fully thinking through your strategy?

Failing to fill in the dots resolves nothing.

Even if you fill in all the dots and decide the next step is not warranted then compliment yourself for seeing that project through to the conclusion.

Win, lose or draw.......fill in the dots and be surprised!
