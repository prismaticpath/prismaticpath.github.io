A bed of flowers signifies spring and a place of beauty where we dwell in bliss.

All flowers stop blooming and we need to wait 12 months for them to come back.

Where do you go for bliss when there are no more spring flowers?

Bliss can be found within when you allow the feeling of spring to linger.
