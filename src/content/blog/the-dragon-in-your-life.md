Dragons come into our lives and provide the most unpleasant of experiences.

Fire breathing, nasty and downright hurtful. Dragons are in fact mythical but exist in the minds of humans who let them in.

Dragons use and abuse you and love to see you fail and be destroyed.

Dragons however are easy to erradicate.

Overcome the dragons who taunt you and who wish to destroy you through the power of your intellect. Develop the strategies to deal with and kill the Dragons that lurk in your world.

After all they are only mythical.
