The impressions we make take place in the first 15 seconds of meeting a person or in how we present ourselves.

Our impressions last a long time and should not be taken for granted.

Imagine you exist between dark and light and then you emerge into the light.

Do you emerge shining and original or as a clone of the darkness and shrouded in a cloak of someone you are not?

Your impression is valuable. Use it authentically and often.
