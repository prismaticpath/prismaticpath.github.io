Renewal is my constant.  
Like a flower blooms.

It pervades my senses daily  
as I uncover another gem  
to shine multiple light on my fingers  
as they type what comes from deep within.

Renewal of the old,  
renewal applied to the future  
and renewal of now.

Immaculate we share the beauty  
from self expression and genuine emotion.
