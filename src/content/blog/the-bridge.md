When encountering a bridge do you immediately cross over.

What awaits on the other side ? Is the other man's grass greener on the other side?

Most will cross a bridge when they know whats on the other side. The fact remains we never know exactly what we will encounter.

Do you wait for the ferryman or boldly cross the bridge to explore a brave new world??
