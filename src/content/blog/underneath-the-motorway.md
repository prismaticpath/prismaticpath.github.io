We travel on the motorway of life, getting from A to B.

Which A? Which B?

Perhaps we may grumble and complain about having to pay the toll.

Or perhaps we have been reckless and received a speeding fine.

Or perhaps there has been an unfortunate accident up ahead, and now we are stuck in traffic.

I wonder what life underneath the motorway is like.
