Picking up a favourite album, or perhaps one we have never heard before.

Putting it on the turntable, spinning the vinyl, lowering the stylus, hearing the first pop, followed by some crackle, and then finally the music. The glorious music.

Dancing. Or foot tapping. Or simply closing the eyes, and giving in to the enjoyment.

In life, are we the needle, or the groove? The creator, or the listener? Do we like what we are listening to, or is it just noise? Change the tune, or let it keep playing?
