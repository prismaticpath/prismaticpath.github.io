We often see life as a set of stairs to climb. Each step represents an event or achievement.

Birth, school, first love, first job, onwards and ever upwards.

Woe if we ever fall. We may break and never be the same again.

But stairs were built to connect different levels via a set of climbable steps.

What is climbable for you may not for me.

Perhaps it's worthwhile looking at which levels we actually want to reach, and perhaps explore different ways to getting there.
