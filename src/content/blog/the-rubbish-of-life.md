Life is full of it. Rubbish, rubbish, rubbish.

It pervades our ears and eyes all day everyday.

If you allow it to, it eats away at your valuable time.

When we recognise the smell and sight of rubbish in our lives, avoid it, dismiss it and stay pure to your dreams.

Replace rubbish with ideals and positivity.

Look on up not around. Avoid the rubbish of life.
