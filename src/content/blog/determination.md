Its all too easy to give up.

Its someone else's fault. Its all too hard, I dont care. Why me. Nothing works.

When this negative mindset comes your way and lets be honest everyone does it, then replace old with new, replace negative with positive.

But you cry out I tried and it did not work! In those circumstances you stopped too early in the replacement of your mindset. To defeat giving up use repetition as your weapon of choice. Repetition of the same positive affirmation will give you determination which in turn leads to a better life and success at what ever you do.

Repetition of the positive is the weapon that wins through applied determination.
