The window of intrigue  
opening to a new world its colours  
denote sky water and earth.

Do we think and watch just the window  
or open it a little to quench our inquisitive minds?

The window when fully open  
leads to a place of revelation  
if we have an open mind  
and seek more to enrich our senses.
