Renewal............it happens when you believe in yourself

Renewal comes to us after sometimes the worst possible moments. We exist in a continual winter that never ends, onwards in an litany of self doubt and regurgitated low self esteem.

However look around you ad what do you see?? Renewal!!!

Like Spring itself, renewal always arrives. be renewal ready as deep within you is the ability to overcome and burst forth in to your next stage, the stage of renewal.
