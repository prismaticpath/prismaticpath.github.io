Looking at a distant view is safe. Its not close to us, we are not impacted by whats there and we dont have to worry.

But intrigue takes over.

I want to go to the distant view. I want to discover.

The distant view finally becomes reality. I am here.

Was the distant view as we thought it might be?

Were our expectations the same as reality?

No its different. My fantasy is not reality.

Views are always beautiful when we simply gaze.

Reality should never surprise us.
