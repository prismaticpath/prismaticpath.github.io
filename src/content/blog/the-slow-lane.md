In a world obsessed with " fast" would it be better to live in the slow lane?

No petrol, no air conditioning, no electric windows, no GPS, no lane assist nor reverse parking third eyes.

The Slow Lane was the only form of "fast" 120 years ago.And its still in use today.

Did the Slow Lane get there? Yes it did.

Is getting there faster really important or is the Slow Lane still as good.
