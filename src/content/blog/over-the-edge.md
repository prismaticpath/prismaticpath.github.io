Going Over The Edge is not something most would undertake.

Its scary down there and I may never return.

However being ready to go over the edge is a state of mind worth considering.

Its all about having the guts to say.......I can do it because Im prepared for a challenge.

Going over the edge is a feeling you have inside......you are secure in yourself and your determination is all that matters.

Look over the edge and ask...can I do it?
