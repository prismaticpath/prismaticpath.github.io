summary: Should technology and data literacy be as important as (or even more important
  than) the Three Rs?
title: The new literacy

Once upon a time, only monks and scholars knew how to read and write.

Today, universal literacy is considered a norm for civilised societies, and an aspiration for developing countries.

Similarly, once upon a time, a priesthood (called the Information Technology department) knew how to operate and use computers.

Today, technology and data literacy is rapidly becoming a norm, and an aspiration for many.

Some say the ability to code will become as important, perhaps more important, than the ability to read and write. The ability to interpret data will become as important as mathematics.

Are you technology literate? Should you be?
