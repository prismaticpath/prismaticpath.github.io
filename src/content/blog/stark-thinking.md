Feeling stuck in a rut, cold, featureless thinking surrounding you? Yes its stark thinking which comes from shutting down and accepting the status quo as reality.

Examples of Stark Thinking include waiting for someone else to give you inspiration, being told to follow a set of instructions that cannot be changed or perhaps even not believing in yourself.

If you doubt you have incredible intellectual powers, then Stark Thinking has got a hold of you.

Replace stark with multi colours, replace stark people with vibrant personalities, replace stark results with your goals for success.
