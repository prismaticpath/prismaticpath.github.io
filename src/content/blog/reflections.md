Reflections look back at us  
and never fail to be truthful  
in communicating our goals and endeavours.  
Sometimes they are glassy and still  
and a reality check on our inertia.  
Others sparkle and glimmer  
with the delights of inner success  
no matter what our level of outcome.

If you felt good peering into your reflections  
regardless of success  
then you truly have arrived at inner peace  
and accept every achievement as the best ever.  
Acceptance of what is not what might.

Look into your reflections.  
What do you see ...  
glassy and still or full of sparkles?  
Both are good if you choose to reflect  
and take time out from eternal struggle and lack of self love.
