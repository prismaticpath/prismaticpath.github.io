Old and new applies to everyone.

We all have use by dates, experience fatigue, burn out, regrowth and ultimately fresh beginnings.

Old and new is a cycle that has persisted over thousands of years.

In human terms being old is regarded as boring and redundant, whilst the young are regarded as new and exciting with more to offer.

But problem!! The new dont know what awaits where as the old have seen it countless times and are ready for the bandits and thieves of life.

Old maybe boring and lacking in excitement, but the new must learn from the old before they themselves become old.
