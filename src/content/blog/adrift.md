Adrift for years you arrive on a desert island. Only you and one other for support.

No money, no food, no shelter. What comes next?

Being adrift and helpless does not mean disaster.

In fact far from it. It opens the door for teamwork. Trust and sharing with another to solve life's awful moments.

Think of it as a time with a mentor who pays attention to your thinking and you to their thinking.Together and with harmony of purpose you both win......no longer adrift.
