Yes we come across it regularly, those unusual, deceptive and plain silly situations. The Monkeys who play games, conduct idle chatter and promote their own egos at the expense of someone else.

Monkey Business can be very destructive unless we have a policy on how to handle such infantile behaviour.

If we adopt a policy of no tolerance we save ourselves considerable wasted time dealing with Monkey Business. The Monkeys only seek a reward for contributing nothing.

So no free bananas!!

The Monkey goes away.
