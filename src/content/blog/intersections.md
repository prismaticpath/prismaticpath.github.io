Delays  
yellow light not yet green

Queues of life  
awaiting departure

The energy swells

The Yellow lights  
are made green  
through sheer will power  
and the desire for purity of fulfillment

The momentum is dizzying to the mind  
through the inner power of a laser focus

The goal I see distinctly
