Soaring Skywards is at times simply not possible. Many feel glued to the ground and unable to lift off from anxiety, failure, lack of self esteem and the inevitable feeling of " I am not good enough".

Rather than feel sorry for yourself take a walk in the bush or forest find an old tree that continues to thrive centuries after it first started growing.Admire the tree and then look up following the tree to the sky above.

Chances are that the tree you found has resisted fires, droughts, pests, the threat of chain saws and has provided shelter to numerous animals and birds.

Where does that tree fit into your thinking?

The answer lies in your ability to look up and keep your eyes fixated on your goals. If the tree inspired you with its continual growth despite set backs, then what have you got to worry about?
