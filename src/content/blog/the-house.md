Your House, what is within the walls ? What goes on behind the windows?

If you are an open house you have happiness in your heart, you are accepting, able to let others in and can give of yourself without hesitation.

If you doors are closed, the windows locked and the blinds drawn, we are locking out the very world that needs us so much.

Is your house welcoming or simply an empty shell?
