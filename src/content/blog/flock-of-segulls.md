A flock of seagulls........the scavengers.

The Seagull's purpose in life is to steal from someone else and make a living from the scraps of others. They fight amongst each other for the final morsels and one Seagull is always the most vocal in who's the greatest scavenger of all.

Sound like a familiar story?

In your life are you individual, the creator of patient strategies and carefully considered plans that bring in the big fish?

Or are you a Seagull who fights for left overs, only picking up the scraps of life.

Just another greedy seagull?
