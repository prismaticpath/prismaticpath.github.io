When cast adrift we look for a safe place. A piece of terra firma where we can be escape the dangers of the troubled waters.

We see an island in the distance, but our boat is sinking.

Should I swim to safety?

What about the sharks they are all around?

Yes..... I shall swim to safety and trust in my abilities to survive.

I made it to the island safely.

I fought off the sharks and established my new life on the island.
