Life is like being on a river.  
We don't get to choose which river  
but we drift along it.

---

At times the river is calm  
and moves forward at a good pace.  
The scenery around the river is breathtakingly beautiful.

---

But sometimes the river can be treacherous and wild.  
A dangerous waterfall looms ahead.  
We can feel totally helpless and powerless.

---

If there is a life-saving branch,  
grab onto it  
and cling onto it for safety.

---

In the end, we all get to meet the sea.
