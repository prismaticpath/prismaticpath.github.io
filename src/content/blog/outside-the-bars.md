Sometimes we feel caged in, almost in a cell.

But we see a view outside, a free happy place.

But we cannot go there as our cage locks us in.

The cage is within you. The cage full of failure, remorse, guilt and unhappiness. The bars of the cage can be broken and your soul set free as it was when you first came into the world.

Outside the cage does exist, the distance to freedom is merely one step.
