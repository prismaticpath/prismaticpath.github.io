summary: Is consciousness a wave function?

According to Quantum theory, particles that make up the universe do not have precise or unique states, but in fact exist as a superposition of states in accordance to a probability function.

As we are made up of these particles, perhaps we can also be described as a superposition of multiple states all coexisting with different probabilities.

All the emotions we feel, our relationships with others, the things we did, or could have done, or should have done ...

Maybe they all exist simultaneously, and there is no one path in life, but multiple paths that we experience with different probabilities.

Some have theorised that it is consciousness that collapses the wave function. But perhaps it is possible to maintain multiple states of consciousness.
