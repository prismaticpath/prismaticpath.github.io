Prismatic Path is a collaboration between [Chris Tham](__GHOST_URL__/author/chris/) and [Greg Allardice](__GHOST_URL__/author/greg/). This site contains a series of musings, ruminations, thoughts and considerations that invite you to explore a path or a journey that you may not have otherwise considered.

This site is written in [Astro](https://astro.build), using the [Astro Blog](https://github.com/ChristineTham/astro-blog) starter, and hosted on Github Pages.
